            <h2>About the Game</h2>
            <p>
                Set in a distant future where humanity is nothing but a distant memory, <em>Synthetic Expanse</em> places you in control of a mysterious being navigating a galaxy full of opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Explore a hand-crafted universe filled with stars, planets, moons, stations, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Engage in strategic trade: buy, sell, and manage your resources, assets, properties, and entire colonies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take your wealth beyond the stars by establishing factories and production lines. Crafting in <em>Synthetic Expanse</em> is as detailed as creating silicon from rocks. And it goes further; manufacture computers, flight systems, and entire ships from the smallest components, such as wires and screws, to engines and weapon systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Create factions with like-minded individuals, claim your territory, and fight in epic fleet battles that shape the course of interstellar politics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lead a story shaped by a series of events that have defined the universe to its current form. A story so rich, that thereâ€™s an unfinished GitBook about it. As a player, you have the power to decide what happens next.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a feature scope as vast as space itself and a world where every decision matters, <strong>Synthetic Expanse</strong> offers an unparalleled gaming experience right within its Discord server. Shape your destiny, forge alliances, and immerse yourself in a living, breathing galaxy where the possibilities are as limitless as the stars.

            <h2>Main Setting</h2>
            <p>As the image echoes loudly, "Helios" is a name you'll hear often. Centuries after the death of their great leader, the Galactic Ultimatum Federation continues to stand. It's one of the two NPC factions, the biggest and the only one which <i>currently</i> the player can align to. The player starts at the Helios system, the capital of the Federation. Players are thrust into the middle of an economic tension and political confusion, where the wealthiest families have splintered from the Federation to form their own faction, Quasar Establishment. Is this the dawn of a prosperous alliance between two factions in an infinite universe? Or the start of a conflict that will only end with the last one standing? Time will tell.</p>
